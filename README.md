Clustering MNIST dataset
================================
For the preprocessing phase, an appropriate dimension reduction method is used. In this project, 3 different unsupervised
learning algorithms including K-means, Bernoulli Mixture Model, and Multinomial Mixture Model implemented on MNIST dataset.
Results of different approaches compared using evaluation metrics like randIndex, Macro-F1, and Micro-F1.
